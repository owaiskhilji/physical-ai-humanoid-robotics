# Selected Text Mode Tasks

## Prompt
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response
Generated comprehensive task breakdown for Selected Text Mode feature with dual-mode logic. Created `specs/001-selected-text-mode/tasks.md` with 65 detailed tasks organized across 9 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (environment preparation)
- Phase 2: Foundational Components (models and schemas)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Dual-Mode Chatbot Functionality (P1 priority)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Visual Indicator (P2 priority)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Strict Grounding (P3 priority)
- Phase 6: API Endpoints and Contracts
- Phase 7: Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Phase 8: Performance and Validation
- Phase 9: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths using JavaScript (.js/.jsx) extensions as appropriate for the project. Tasks are organized by user story priority to enable independent implementation and testing. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.

## Outcome
Task breakdown complete with all 65 tasks properly formatted. Ready for implementation phase with clear file paths and dependencies. MVP scope identified as User Story 1 (core dual-mode functionality).
