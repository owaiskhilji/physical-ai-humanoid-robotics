# Response Text

Generated comprehensive task list for Frontend Integration and Chat Widget Development (feature branch 003-rag-chatbot). Tasks organized in 6 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (environment, dependencies)
- Phase 2: Foundational components (models, state management, API services)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 (core chat functionality) - P1 priority
- Phase 4: User Story 2 (backend integration) - P2 priority
- Phase 5: User Story 3 (accessibility/responsiveness) - P3 priority
- Phase 6: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

Created 55 specific, actionable tasks following the required format with checkboxes, task IDs, story labels, and file paths. Identified parallel execution opportunities and defined MVP scope (User Story 1) for incremental delivery. All tasks mapped to requirements from the specification and design documents.

# Outcome

Task generation complete with 55 actionable items organized by user story priority. Ready for implementation phase. MVP scope clearly defined as User Story 1 (core chat functionality).
